        Hello, my name is Benjamin Thomsen (Benj for short). I was born in Raleigh, North Carolina and have lived here my whole life. I graduated from Appalachian State University with a degree in Sustainable Technology and a Minor in Physics in May of 2018. I am also currently enrolled in classes through the UNC Chapel Hill coding bootcamp where I learned to make this webpage and much more. In my personal life, I enjoy backpacking, playing basketball, and playing ultimate frisbee.
        I played five years of college ultimate, and have played four years of summer elite club with a local team called Turbine.
        I have also been on the practice squad for two professional ultimate teams: The Charlotte Express, and The Raleigh Flyers. I am currently looking for work doing some kind of software development. I have become very familiar with javascript, html and css as well as databases such as Google Firebase, MySql and MongoDB. I know node.js as well as React and understand the fundamentals of both front-end and back-end technologies and how to deploy them properly.
